  <p class="nhsuk-body">Dear Joe Doe,</p>
  <p class="nhsuk-body">We have recently been asked to remove you from the NHS Cervical Screening Programme by your GP
    or clinic.</p>
  <p class="nhsuk-body">Because of this, we have removed your name from the invitation list. You will not receive any
    more cervical screening invitations or reminders.</p>

   <h5 class="nhsuk-heading-xs">Why you have been removed</h5>
  <p class="nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-2">You are no longer eligible for cervical screening because you will be over the age of 65 
when your next test is due.<p>
  <p class="nhsuk-body">You are highly unlikely to develop cervical cancer if you are 65 and over and do not have 
a recent history of abnormal screening results.</p>

<h3 class="nhsuk-heading-s nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-3">More information</h3>
  <p>Speak to a GP as soon as possible if you have any of the following symptoms, regardless of your cervical screening
    history:</p>
  <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
    <li>vaginal bleeding that’s unusual for you – including bleeding during or after sex, between your periods or after
      the menopause, or heavier periods than usual </li>
    <li>changes to your vaginal discharge</li>
    <li>pain during sex</li>
    <li>pain in your lower back, between your hip bones (pelvis), or in your lower tummy</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If you think our information is incorrect or you have any questions, contact a GP or your nearest sexual health
    clinic.</p>
